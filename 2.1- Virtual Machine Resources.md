### Virtual Machine Resources
---
Summary:
- Workload controllers manage application lifecycles inside OpenShift.
- VMs in OpenShift Virtualization work similarly to StatefulSets but are managed using virt-launcher pods.
- Multiple network options exist, including default pod networks, Multus for multiple interfaces, and SR-IOV for high performance.
- Storage options include PVC-backed storage and boot sources like golden images.
- virsh and virtctl provide command-line management for VMs.

Workload Controllers in OpenShift: OpenShift provides different types of workload controllers to manage applications running as pods inside the cluster.
- Deployments: Create and manage application instances using pod templates. They ensure the desired number of running instances.
- Replica Sets: Maintain the specified number of healthy pod replicas.
- Daemon Sets: Ensure a pod runs on every node that matches a selector, regardless of replica count.
- Stateful Sets: Used for stateful applications, ensuring unique, consistent storage and network identities for pods.

Difference Between Workload Controllers, VMs, and VMIs:
- VM (Virtual Machine): Simulates hardware resources like CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces.
- VMI (Virtual Machine Instance): A running instance of a VM inside OpenShift.
- Relationship: A VM acts like a template, while a VMI is the running instance (similar to Deployments and ReplicaSets in Kubernetes).
- Process Flow:
  - A VM is created.
  - virt-controller signals virt-handler to create a virt-launcher pod.
  - virt-launcher manages the VMI using libvirtd.

Components of an OpenShift Virtual Machine:
- Console Access: VNC (graphical/text), Serial Console (text), and RDP (Windows GUI).
- Network Interfaces:
  - Pod Network: Default, uses NAT for internal cluster access.
  - Multus: Enables multiple network interfaces (external and internal).
  - SR-IOV: High-performance networking for VMIs.
- Persistent Storage:
  - Persistent Volume (PV): Represents actual storage.
  - Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): Requests storage for a VMI.
- Boot Sources: Disk images from sources like RAW, QCOW2, ISOs, container disks, or PVCs.
- Golden Images: Preconfigured OS images, updated and synchronized automatically in OpenShift.
- Configuration Maps and Secrets: Used for centralized application configuration.

VM Lifecycle in OpenShift:
- virt-controller detects a new VMI.
- virt-handler on a node starts the virt-launcher pod.
- The virt-launcher pod runs libvirtd, which starts the VMI.
- Network and storage resources are attached.
- The VM can be accessed via virsh or virtctl CLI tools.

VM Management Commands:
Using virsh inside virt-launcher pod:
```bash
virsh list               # List running VMs
virsh start <vm-name>    # Start a VM
virsh shutdown <vm-name> # Graceful shutdown
virsh reset <vm-name>    # Force reset
virsh migrate <vm-name>  # Migrate VM to another node
```
Using virtctl CLI:
```bash
virtctl stop <vm-name>   # Stop a VM
virtctl start <vm-name>  # Start a VM
```

Standalone VMIs vs. Managed VMs:
- Managed VMs: Created using OpenShift Virtualization tools (VM templates, instance types, declarative manifests).
- Standalone VMIs: Created manually using CLI commands.
- To list all VMIs: `oc get vmis -A`

Methods to Create a VM:
- Templates: Predefined settings from Red Hat or custom-defined.
- Instance Types: Standardized VM configurations with predefined CPU and memory.
- Declarative YAML Files: Infrastructure-as-Code approach for automation. `oc create -f vm.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: mariadb-prod
spec:
  running: true
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        memory:
          guest: 512Mi
```
