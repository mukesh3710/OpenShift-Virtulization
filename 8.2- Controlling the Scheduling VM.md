### Controlling the Scheduling

How VM Scheduling Works in OpenShift:
By default, OpenShift schedules VMs/pods to the most suitable nodes, but you might want more control—like ensuring VMs run:
- On nodes with specific hardware
- Together (affinity)
- Apart (anti-affinity)

Node Selector (Basic Scheduling):
- This is the simplest way to schedule a VM on a specific node.
- Example use case: You have a node with GPU hardware labeled gpu=true, and want your VM to run only there.
- Exact match of key-value labels on nodes. If no match found, VM won’t schedule.

Affinity & Anti-Affinity (Advanced Rules):
- These allow more flexible, rule-based scheduling.
- Node Affinity: Match nodes based on conditions (e.g. availability zones, labels).
```yaml
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  nodeSelectorTerms:
  - matchExpressions:
    - key: zone
      operator: In
      values:
      - zone1
```
- Pod Affinity: Schedule VMs with certain pods.
```yaml
podAffinity:
  requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  - labelSelector:
      matchExpressions:
      - key: app
        operator: In
        values:
        - frontend
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```
- Pod Anti-Affinity: Schedule VMs away from certain pods. Below topologyKey defines the grouping level (node name, rack, zone).
```yaml
podAntiAffinity:
  preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  - weight: 100
    podAffinityTerm:
      labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: app
          operator: In
          values:
          - backend
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

Taints and Tolerations:
- Used to prevent VMs from running on certain nodes unless they explicitly tolerate it. Helps isolate workloads (e.g., reserve nodes for infra workloads only).
- Taint (on node)
```yaml
spec:
  taints:
  - key: "virtualization"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
- Toleration (on VM):
```
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "virtualization"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "true"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

Run Strategy (VM Lifecycle Control):
- .spec.running: true | false
- Simple control: whether the VM is running or not.
  - true: Keeps VM running; auto-restarts on failure or manual stop
  - false: VM is powered off
- .spec.runStrategy: Always | RerunOnFailure | Halted | Manual
  - Always	VM should always run, restarts automatically (like .running: true)
  - RerunOnFailure	VM restarts only on failures (not after shutdown)
  - Halted	VM stays off
  - Manual	No automatic action, manual control required
- You can only use one of runStrategy or running — not both.

Web Console Usage:
- Go to Virtualization → VirtualMachines
- Select your VM → Configuration → Scheduling
- Add: Node selectors, Affinity rules & Tolerations
- Restart VM to apply
