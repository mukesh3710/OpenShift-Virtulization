### Health Probes

Health probes monitor the state of applications running inside VMs (not just Pods). They help Kubernetes/OpenShift decide whether to:
- Route traffic to the VM (readiness)
- Restart the VM (liveness)

Types of Probes:
- Readiness Probe:
  - Checks if the application is ready to receive traffic.
  - If the check fails, the VM's IP is removed from the service, and traffic stops.
  - When the app is ready again, it resumes traffic.
  - Use cases: App is slow to start, temporarily overloaded, or busy.
- Liveness Probe:
  - Checks if the application is alive.
  - If it fails, OpenShift deletes and recreates the VM instance (VMI).
  - Use cases: App is stuck, needs full restart.

Probe Methods:
- HTTP GET:	App has a health endpoint (like /health)	(Web apps)
- TCP Socket	App listens on a TCP port (e.g. databases)	(MariaDB on port 3306_
- Guest Agent Ping (Preview only)	You have QEMU guest agent installed	(Not widely used yet)

How to Configure Probes (YAML Snippet):
- Example: Readiness Probe for a web app
```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 120  # wait before checking
  periodSeconds: 20         # check every 20s
  timeoutSeconds: 10        # wait 10s max for response
  failureThreshold: 3       # fail after 3 bad tries
  successThreshold: 3       # need 3 successes to mark as healthy
```
- Example: Liveness Probe for MariaDB
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 3306
  initialDelaySeconds: 120
  periodSeconds: 20
```
- You add these using: `oc edit vm <vm-name>`
- Or use the OpenShift Web Console → Virtualization → VirtualMachines → Edit YAML.

Watchdog Devices:
- A watchdog monitors the VM’s OS, not just applications.
- If the OS becomes unresponsive (frozen), the watchdog restarts the VM.
- This is hardware-emulated in OpenShift using Intel 6300ESB chipset.
- A timer (default 30s) runs inside the VM.
- OS is responsible for resetting this timer regularly.
- If the OS hangs and can't reset it → timer expires → VM gets rebooted.
- Use watchdog only when probes can't detect unresponsiveness (like full OS freeze).
- YAML Snippet
```yaml
devices:
  watchdog:
    i6300esb:
      action: poweroff  # options: poweroff, reset, shutdown
    name: mywatchdog
```
- You can configure this with: `oc edit vm <vm-name>`
- Or use the YAML editor in the Web Console.
