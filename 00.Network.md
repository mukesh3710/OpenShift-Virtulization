### SDN

- OpenShift uses a software-defined networking (SDN) model to manage communication between pods, services, and nodes. When you install OpenShift (using IPI or UPI), you configure three key networks (Cluster Network, Machine Network & Service Network)
- Cluster Network: Internal network for Pods to communicate with each other across nodes. Every Pod gets an IP from this range, and SDN/OVN-Kubernetes handles Pod A on Node1 → Pod B on Node2 uses Cluster Network (routing.CIDR: 10.128.0.0/14)
- Machine Network: Network for the nodes themselves (control plane and worker nodes) to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Set during install; must include all node IPs. 
- Service Network: Virtual network for Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP) to expose applications internally. Pods talk to Services via this network using kube-proxy.
- How They Work Together
  - Pod → Pod → Cluster Network
  - Pod → Service → Service Network
  - Node communication → Machine Network

Pod and Service Networking: 
- Pods: Each Pod gets an IP from the Cluster Network (e.g., 10.128.0.12). Pods can directly talk to each other across nodes. Example: Pod A (10.128.0.12) → Pod B (10.128.1.8)
- Services: A Service gets a virtual IP from the Service Network (e.g., 172.30.100.50) and acts as an internal load balancer for Pods. DNS (e.g., myapp.default.svc.cluster.local) resolves to this IP. Example: Pod A → Service (172.30.100.50) → routes to backend Pods.
---
External Access: 
- NodePort: Exposes service on each node’s IP at a static port (e.g., NodeIP:30080).
- LoadBalancer: Uses external load balancer (cloud or MetalLB) for single IP.
- Ingress/Route (OpenShift): Provides HTTP/HTTPS access via DNS (e.g., https://myapp.apps.example.com).
