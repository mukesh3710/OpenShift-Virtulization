### Configuring External Access to Virtual Machines
---
Summary:
- Create a Service for the VM.
- Create a Route or Ingress for external access.
- If using network policies, allow traffic from openshift-ingress.
- For TLS security, configure routes with proper TLS termination.
---

Service Types for External Access:
- NodePort: Opens a port on each node in the cluster, forwarding traffic to the targeted service. This requires direct node access and is less secure.
- LoadBalancer: Automatically provisions an external load balancer (in cloud environments) to route traffic to the application. In bare-metal environments, MetalLB or External IPs can be used.
- Ingress Controller: Manages HTTP(S) traffic using routes. It’s the primary way to expose applications externally in OpenShift.

OpenShift Routes:
- Routes map external traffic to internal services.
- The OpenShift router (based on HAProxy) handles incoming traffic and forwards it based on defined routes.
- Format: routename-namespace.default_domain `intranet-prod.mycompany.com`
- Command-line: `oc expose service/web`
- Custom DNS: `oc expose service/web --hostname web-production.apps.mycompany.com`
- Web Console: Navigate to Networking → Routes, select namespace, and define the route.

Path-Based Routing:
- Allows different services to be accessible under the same domain using paths.
```bash
oc expose service/static --path=/static --hostname=intranet-prod.apps.mycompany.com
oc expose service/restapi --path=/api --hostname=intranet-prod.apps.mycompany.com
```
- /static → static web content
- /api → backend service

Encrypted Routes (TLS/HTTPS):
- Three types of TLS termination:
- Edge: TLS is terminated at the router (traffic inside the cluster is unencrypted).
- Passthrough: TLS is handled by the application (router forwards encrypted traffic).
- Re-encryption: TLS is terminated at the router, then re-encrypted before forwarding.

Creating Encrypted Routes:
- Web Console: Under Create Route, set TLS options.
- CLI: `oc create route edge --service web --hostname api.apps.acme.com` Add --cert, --key, and --ca-cert options for custom certificates.

Configuring Routes for VMs:
- Since VMs run as pods (virt-launcher pods), they need a Service before exposing them via a route.
- Create a Service for the VM
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web
  namespace: prod2
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    tier: front
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```
- Expose the VM service as a route: `oc expose service/web`

Network Policy Considerations:
- If network policies are enabled, router pods (running in openshift-ingress namespace) need to be explicitly allowed.
- Example policy:
```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
```

Kubernetes Ingress vs OpenShift Routes:
- Ingress is the standard Kubernetes method for external access, while Routes are OpenShift-specific with additional features like TLS re-encryption.
- Example Ingress definition:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  rules:
    - host: web-production.apps.mycompany.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: web
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

### Exercise

The process of exposing a virtual machine (VM) running inside an OpenShift cluster to external traffic while ensuring network security:
- Add the app: helloworld label in the spec.template.metadata.labels path. As a reminder, Kubernetes uses this labels section to assign the label to the virt-launcher pod. Do not change the other labels sections. `oc edit vm/rhel9`
- Restart the VM so that Kubernetes re-creates an instance that includes the new label. From the web console, click the vertical ellipsis icon ⋮ to the right of the rhel9 VM and then click Restart.
- Create a service named rhel9-web with the ClusterIP type. Use the app: helloworld label for the selector. The hello-web service must accept traffic on TCP port 80 and forward it to the VM on port 80: `oc create service clusterip rhel9-web --tcp=80:80 --dry-run=client -o yaml > rhel9-web-service.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: rhel9-web
  name: rhel9-web
spec:
  ports:
  - name: 80-80
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: helloworld # update here 
  type: ClusterIP
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
```
- Open the rhel9-web-service.yaml manifest in an editor and modify the selector to app: helloworld. Save the change to the file.
- Use the oc create command to create the service. The service makes the VM available on a stable IP address: `oc create -f rhel9-web-service.yaml`
- Confirm that the rhel9-web service uses the VMI as an active endpoint: `oc get vmi,endpoints`
- Use the OpenShift web console to create a route for the rhel9-web service. Networking → Routes → Select Project → Create Route
  - Name	rhel9-web
  - Hostname	Leave the default value
  - Path	Leave the default value
  - Service	rhel9-web
  - Target port	80 → 80(TCP)
- Click Create to create the route. The Route details page is displayed.
- Click the link in Location section to confirm that you can access the web application that is running on the VM.
- Add a network policy to allow traffic from the route. `oc create -f allow-rhel9-web-np.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-hello-web-route
  namespace: vm
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld
  ingress:
    - ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443
      from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
```
- Add TLS edge termination to encrypt traffic between the client and the router.
  - go to Networking → Routes. Select Project
  - Select Action → Edit route and scroll to the Security section of the form.
  - Click the Secure Route checkbox. TLS termination appears under the checkbox. Set the TLS termination value to Edge. Click Save.
  - Click the link in Location to confirm that you can access the web application that is running on the VM from the https URL. The web application displays a Hello world page in a new web browser tab.
