### OADP Operator Deployment and Features Explanation

OADP Overview: OADP is Red Hat's native backup solution for OpenShift. It integrates with Velero and Kopia to manage backups and restores of applications and their data.
Main Components
- Velero: Primary backup tool that provides APIs for backup and restore.
- Data Mover: Moves snapshots to remote storage using Kopia and CSI plug-ins.
- Kopia: Handles backup of persistent volumes using encryption and deduplication.

OADP 1.4.1 Enhancements:
- Supports backup and restore of virtual machines (VMs) in OpenShift Virtualization.
- Uses the same OADP resources for both Kubernetes and VM backups.
- Requires OpenShift Virtualization 4.14 or later (OADP 1.3.x or later is needed).

Backup Process:
- Kubernetes Resource Backup
  - Uses Velero to back up all OpenShift/Kubernetes resources to object storage.
  - Allows filtering based on namespace, resource type, or labels.
- Persistent Volume (PV) Backup
  - Uses CSI snapshot API to create snapshots of persistent volumes.
  - Snapshots are faster and more consistent than file-based backups.
- OADP Data Mover (For Persistent Volume Snapshots)
  - Moves snapshots to remote object storage for better disaster recovery.
  - Uses Kopia to encrypt and upload snapshot data.

Velero Plug-ins and Storage Support:
- Velero Plug-ins Plug-ins extend OADP to support different cloud providers and storage solutions
- AWS: Backup to S3-compatible storage and snapshot EBS volumes.
- GCP: Backup to Google Cloud Storage and snapshot Compute Engine disks.
- Azure: Backup to Azure Blob Storage and snapshot Azure Managed Disks.
- OpenShift: Backups include container images from OpenShiftâ€™s internal registry.
- KubeVirt: Required for VM backup and restore in OpenShift Virtualization.
- CSI: Adds support for volume snapshots via the Kubernetes CSI Snapshot API.
- For Data Mover, you must enable CSI, KubeVirt, and OpenShift plug-ins.

OADP API Resources:
- DataProtectionApplication:	Defines OADP operator configuration.
- BackupStorageLocation:	Specifies where backups are stored.
- VolumeSnapshotLocation:	Specifies the storage location for snapshots.
- Backup:	Triggers Velero to create a backup.
- Restore:	Triggers Velero to restore a backup.
- Schedule:	Defines a backup schedule using Cron.
- BackupRepository:	Manages the lifecycle of backup repositories.

OADP Requirements:
- User Permissions
  - Requires cluster-admin privileges for installation and management.
  - Backup and restore require admin access to the OADP namespace (openshift-adp).
- Object Storage
  - OADP requires an S3-compatible object storage to store backups:
    - Supported providers: AWS S3, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud, OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF).
    - ODF Storage Types: NooBaa MultiCloud Gateway (MCG), Ceph RADOS Object Gateway (RGW).
- Example of an ObjectBucketClaim (OBC) for ODF storage: Creates an S3-compatible bucket with credentials stored in a secret. The backup storage endpoint is available via OpenShift Routes.
```yaml
apiVersion: objectbucket.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObjectBucketClaim
metadata:
  name: vm-bucket-claim
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  storageClassName: openshift-storage.noobaa.io
  generateBucketName: vm-bucket
```

Installing and Configuring OADP:
- Install the Operator - Can be installed from OperatorHub or using oc commands.
- Create Data Protection Application (DPA) - A DPA custom resource defines the backup storage and snapshot configuration.
- Example of a DataProtectionApplication (DPA): Enables plug-ins: aws, openshift, csi, kubevirt. Uses Data Mover (nodeAgent) with Kopia for offloading snapshots. Configures S3-compatible storage (vm-bucket) for backups.
```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: oadp-backup
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
        - aws
        - openshift
        - csi
        - kubevirt
      defaultSnapshotMoveData: true
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        provider: aws
        default: true
        credential:
          name: cloud-credentials
          key: cloud
        objectStorage:
          bucket: vm-bucket
          prefix: oadp
```

Backup and Restore Process:
- Backup Process: `oc create -f backup.yaml`  The backup is stored in the defined BackupStorageLocation.
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: my-backup
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  storageLocation: oadp-backup-1
  includedNamespaces:
```
- Restore Process:  `oc create -f restore.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: my-restore
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: my-backup
```

Upgrading OADP:
- Update the OADP operator.
- Upgrade Velero and Data Mover plug-ins.
- Enable defaultSnapshotMoveData for automatic snapshot migration.

Troubleshooting OADP Issues:
- Verify OADP Components: `oc -n openshift-adp get deploy` Should show openshift-adp-controller-manager and velero as READY.
- Verify Backup Storage Location: `oc -n openshift-adp get backupstoragelocation` Should be in the Available phase.
- Check Backup Storage Configuration Errors `oc -n openshift-adp describe backupstoragelocation oadp-backup-1` If Phase: Unavailable, check the AWS Access Key, S3 URL, or Bucket Name.
- Label CSI Volume Snapshot Class, If using CSI snapshots, ensure it's labeled correctly: `oc label volumesnapshotclass my-csi-storageclass velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class="true"`
