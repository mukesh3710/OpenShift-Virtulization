### 

Virtual Machine Templates: Templates are blueprints that define the configuration of a VM — like operating system, CPU, memory, disks, network interfaces, etc.
What they include:
- OS (e.g., RHEL, Windows)
- CPU + Memory sizes (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large)
- Disks (root disk + cloud-init)
- Network interfaces (defaults to pod network)
- Optional customization (cloud-init for Linux, Sysprep for Windows)

Template Disk Source Options:
- PVC (clone): Clone existing PVC.
- Registry: Import image from a container registry.
- URL: Download and import from HTTP/S3.
- Upload: Upload a file to a PVC.
- Blank: Start with an empty disk.

How to use:
- Go to Virtualization → Catalog → Template catalog
- Select a template
- Choose Quick create or Customize (to tweak things like CPU, memory, disks, scripts, etc.)

Instance Types:
- These are preset resource profiles (mainly CPU & memory) for different kinds of workloads.

Instance Type Examples:
- cx1.* = Compute-intensive (dedicated CPUs)
- gn1.* = GPU workloads (NVIDIA)
- m1.* = Memory-intensive
- n1.* = Network-intensive (DPDK apps)
- u1.* = General-purpose

How to use:
- Go to Virtualization → Catalog
- Select InstanceTypes
- Choose a boot volume (e.g., from a bootable image like RHEL 9)
- Select series and size
- Customize cloud-init, SSH keys, etc. if needed
- Click Create VirtualMachine

Preferences:
Preferences are like suggestions (not hard limits like instance types) for VM hardware and software settings. There are VMCP (cluster-wide) and VMP (namespace-scoped) and You can override them when creating the VM. They define:
- Preferred disk bus (virtio, SATA, etc.)
- Disk I/O threading
- Interface model
- And more...

---

Bootable Volumes:
These are golden images (sealed, pre-prepared images) used to boot VMs.  Need RWX access mode PVCs to enable live migration. Managed by the DataSource resource:
- Include metadata: default instance type, preference
- Created from Red Hat registry images (e.g., CentOS, RHEL)
- Stored in openshift-virtualization-os-images project
- Automatically updated using dataimportcron

---

Cloud-Init & Scripts:

cloud-init is used on first boot to:
- Set hostname, users, passwords
- Add SSH keys
- Register system to RHSM (subscription)
- Add yum repos
- Add custom CA certs

Can be customized:
- In form view (GUI): username, password, basic networking
- In script view: full YAML cloud-init scripts
