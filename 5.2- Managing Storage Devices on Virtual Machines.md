### Managing Storage Devices on Virtual Machines

Summary:
- Storage in OpenShift Virtualization is managed using PVCs.
- Multiple disk interfaces are available, with virtio-scsi being the most flexible.
- Disks can be attached/detached, cloned, and resized dynamically.
- Persistent storage sources include ephemeral disks, PVCs, URLs, and registries.
- Expanding a disk requires storage class support and file system resizing inside the VM.

Attaching Multiple Disks to a VM:
- OpenShift Virtualization allows VMs to use multiple disks via Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), which can be:
- Imported from a URL
- Cloned from an existing PVC
- Created as blank storage
- Inside the VM, the storage appears as a disk that can be formatted, partitioned, and mounted. The disk type depends on the interface selected:

Disk Interfaces:
- SCSI: Standard interface; disks appear as /dev/sdX on Linux.
- VirtIO: High-performance interface; disks appear as /dev/vdX, but requires VirtIO drivers.
- VirtIO-SCSI: Newer interface (available in OpenShift 4.16+), supports hot-plugging and removes the limitations of VirtIO.

Hot Plugging Note:
- Only SCSI supports hot plugging on running VMs.
- VirtIO-SCSI removes the need to stop the VM for attaching/removing disks.

Steps to Attach a Disk via OpenShift Web Console:
- Navigate to Virtualization → VirtualMachines.
- Select the VM.
- Go to Overview → Storage.
- Click Add Disk, fill out the form, and attach the disk.

Selecting a Data Volume Source:
- When creating a new disk, the data source determines how it is provisioned:
| Source Type                  | Description                                                                                             | Data Persistence on VM Restart |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Ephemeral (Container Image)** | Uses a disk from a container image; data is lost on VM restart.                                         | Lost                           |
| **PVC (Clone Existing PVC)** | Clones an existing PVC, ensuring the source PVC is unused before cloning.                                | Persistent                     |
| **Empty Disk (Blank)** | Creates an unformatted raw disk for manual formatting and partitioning.                                  | Persistent                     |
| **From URL** | Downloads a virtual disk from a URL (supports raw and qcow2 formats).                                    | Persistent                     |
| **Registry (Creates PVC)** | Pulls a container image with a disk and extracts it into a PVC.                                         | Persistent                     |
| **Upload** | Uploads a qcow2 disk image manually. 
- Important Warning: Avoid attaching a single PVC to multiple VMs simultaneously unless the storage supports ReadWriteMany mode (e.g., NFS).
- Standard filesystems like ext4 or XFS do not support concurrent access, leading to data corruption.

Detaching a Disk from a VM:
- Stop the VM before detaching the disk (unless using virtio-scsi).
- Navigate to Overview → Storage, select the disk, and click Detach.

Deleting the Disk Data:
- Detaching a disk does not delete the associated PVC.
- To permanently delete the disk:
  - Go to Storage → PersistentVolumeClaims.
  - Locate the PVC and delete it.
  - Alternatively, use the command: `oc delete datavolume/mariadb-server-my-disk`

Reattaching an Existing Disk:
- After detaching a disk, it can be reattached to the same or another VM.
- Stop the VM first, then go to Overview → Storage → Add Disk, select PVC, and choose the appropriate PVC.
- Warning: Do not attach a PVC that is already mounted to another VM.

Preallocating Disk Space:
- By default, OpenShift Virtualization allocates disk space on demand. However, preallocation can be enabled for performance benefits.
- Enable Preallocation: Check the Enable Preallocation box in the web console when adding a disk. Or define it in a DataVolume resource:
```yaml
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: datadisk
spec:
  preallocation: true
  storage:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
    storageClassName: ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization
  source:
    blank: {}
```

Resizing a VM Disk (Expanding PVCs):
- OpenShift allows expanding PVCs, but not shrinking them.
- Check if Storage Class Supports Expansion `oc get storageclass ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization -o yaml | grep allowVolumeExpansion` If the output includes allowVolumeExpansion: true, expansion is supported.
- Expanding a PVC via Web Console: Go to Storage → PersistentVolumeClaims. Select the PVC and click Actions → Expand PVC. Enter the new size and confirm.
- Expanding a PVC via CLI: Edit the PVC manually `oc edit pvc/mariadb-server-my-disk-rbd`
```yaml
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi  # Increase the size
```
- Expanding the VM File System: Restart the VM to detect the new disk size. Manually resize partitions and file systems inside the VM. Linux systems with cloud-init may auto-expand partitions on boot.

### Exercise

- This exercise focuses on enhancing the storage implementation for a database VM (MariaDB Server) running on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization by adding, migrating, and removing storage devices dynamically.

Identify the Current Storage Class: 
- Navigate to Configuration → Storage in OpenShift.
- Identify that the dbroot disk uses nfs-storage, which is slow.

Create and Attach New Storage Disks:
- Add three new 5 GiB disks (dbdata, dbredo, dbundo).
- Use the Ceph RBD (ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization) storage class, which is faster.
- Attach them using the SCSI interface (hot-pluggable, no VM restart required).

Verify New Disks Are Available:
- Inside the VM, run lsblk and confirm that the three new 5 GiB disks (sda, sdb, sdc) are attached.

Migrate Database Data to New Disks:
- Run the provided script (dbmove.sh) to:
- Format the new disks.
- Move the MariaDB database files from dbroot to dbdata, dbredo, and dbundo.
- Restart MariaDB Server.

Remove the Old Storage Device:
- Stop the VM from OpenShift Web Console.
- Detach and delete the old dbroot disk.
- Restart the VM and confirm that vdc (the old 15 GiB disk) is no longer present.
