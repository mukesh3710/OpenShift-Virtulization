- By combining NMState and Multus, OpenShift administrators can configure nodes, enable multihomed VMs, and ensure flexible networking across clusters.
- OVS Bridges connect VMs to external networks via the host's NIC.
- OVS vs. Linux Bridges:
  - Linux Bridges = simple, easy to configure, fewer features.
  - OVS Bridges = VLAN tagging, isolation, better automation.
- OVN-Kubernetes L2 Overlay Networks:
  - Enable multi-networking in OpenShift.
  - Support east-west traffic only.
  - Require NetworkAttachmentDefinition (NAD).
- Node Network Configuration Policy (NNCP):
  - Defines OVS bridges for worker nodes.
  - Uses nodeSelector for targeting nodes.
- VM IP Addressing:
  - Default pod network IPs are ephemeral.
  - Static IPs require cloud-init or a DHCP server.

NMState Operator Overview: The NMState operator is a tool in OpenShift that allows you to configure and manage network settings on OpenShift nodes declaratively. It helps in:
- Reporting node network states.
- Applying and validating network configurations.
- Configuring additional network interfaces (e.g., Linux bridges).
- You install the NMState operator from the OperatorHub and then create an NMState instance (nmstate) to deploy the controller on all nodes.

API Resources provided by NMState:
- NodeNetworkState (NNS): Shows the current network configuration of a node.
- NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP): Defines intended network configurations for nodes.
- NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment (NNCE): Monitors the application of NNCP and rolls back changes if needed.
  
Configuring Node Network State (NNS):
- Each OpenShift node has an NNS resource, which reflects its current network state `oc get nns <node-name> -o yaml`
- You can also check Networking â†’ NodeNetworkState in the OpenShift web console.

Configuring Node Network Configuration Policy (NNCP):
- NNCP defines how the node network should be configured. For example, to configure a Linux bridge (br1) on a worker node
```yaml
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: br1-policy
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""   # Apply to worker nodes
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
      - name: br1
        type: linux-bridge
        state: up
        ipv4:
          dhcp: true
          enabled: true
        bridge:
          options:
            stp:
              enabled: false
          port:
            - name: ens4   # Attach ens4 to the bridge
```
- To apply: `oc apply -f br1-policy.yaml`
- To check status: `oc get nncp` `oc get nncp br1-policy -o yaml`
- Removing a bridge or bonding interface makes the attached NIC go down. Ensure a NIC is configured separately to maintain connectivity.

Node Network Configuration Enactment (NNCE):
- After applying an NNCP, an NNCE resource is created for each node affected by the policy. This tracks success or failure. `oc get nnce` `oc get nnce <nnce-name> -o yaml`
- If a failure occurs, NMState rolls back to the previous configuration and logs errors.

Connecting Virtual Machines to Multiple Networks:
- By default, VMs use the default pod network. If a VM needs access to an external network, it requires a Linux bridge (or OVS bridge) and Multus CNI.
- Configuring a Linux Bridge. Create an NNCP (as shown earlier) to configure a bridge. Create a Network Attachment Definition (NAD) to allow VMs to connect:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: br1-bridge-network
spec:
  config: '{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "type": "cnv-bridge",
    "bridge": "br1",
    "vlan": 0,
    "macspoofchk": true
  }'
```
- Apply it: `oc apply -f nad.yaml`
- Attach the NAD to a VM: Go to Virtualization â†’ Virtual Machines. Click Network Interfaces â†’ Add Network Interface. Choose the NAD (br1-bridge-network). Click Add.

Hot Plugging Secondary Network Interfaces:
- OpenShift Virtualization allows hot plugging (adding/removing network interfaces on a running VM).
- Using the Web Console: Navigate to Virtualization â†’ Virtual Machines. Select the VM and go to Configuration â†’ Network Interfaces. Click Add Network Interface, select the NAD, and attach.
- Using the CLI : Edit the VM spec to add the secondary NIC: `oc edit vm vm-fedora` then, live migrate the VM to attach the new interface: `virtctl migrate vm vm-fedora`
```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-fedora
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
            - name: defaultnetwork
              masquerade: {}
            - name: secondary_nic
              bridge: {}
      networks:
        - name: defaultnetwork
          pod: {}
        - name: secondary_nic
          multus:
            networkName: br1-bridge-network
```

### OVS Bridge and Networking in OpenShift Virtualization

OVS Bridge Overview: An Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge is a Layer 2 switch that connects Virtual Machines (VMs) to the external network. It acts as a bridge between the virtual network interface of the VM and the physical network interface of the host system, allowing network traffic to flow between them.
- Traffic from a VM is forwarded through the OVS bridge to the physical NIC of the host system.
- The physical NIC sends the traffic to the external network.
- The OVS bridge is configured on the host system and the VM connects to it through a virtual NIC.

Linux Bridges vs. OVS Bridges:
- Both Linux bridges and OVS bridges provide network connectivity to VMs, but they differ in their capabilities:
| Feature            | Linux Bridge | OVS Bridge | VLAN Tagging |
|--------------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **VLAN Tagging** | No           | Yes        | Yes          |
| **Network Isolation** | No           | Yes        | Yes          |
| **Availability** | Default      | Optional   | N/A (feature of bridges/NICs) |
- Linux Bridges: Easier to configure, but lack advanced features.
- OVS Bridges: Offer better network automation, tunneling, and scalability, making them ideal for OpenShift Virtualization.
- Red Hat recommends OVS bridges in OpenShift environments requiring Multi Network Policy and advanced network features.

OVN-Kubernetes L2 Overlay Network:
- OVN-Kubernetes extends Open vSwitch (OVS) with overlay networks (virtual Layer 2 networks). This allows:
- Multiple isolated networks for different workloads.
- Pod and service networks to be configured as overlays.
- Multus to attach additional networks to pods.
- ðŸ”¹ Limitations: OVN-Kubernetes L2 overlay networks only support east-west traffic (internal cluster communication). NICs on these networ

Connecting VMs to an OVN-Kubernetes L2 Overlay Network:
- Create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition (NAD) using the OVN CNI plug-in.
- Attach the NAD to the VM through the OpenShift web console or CLI
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: ovn-bridge-network
spec:
  config: '{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "ovn-bridge-network",
    "type": "ovn-kubernetes",
    "bridge": "ovs-br0",
    "isGateway": true,
    "ipam": {
      "type": "host-local",
      "subnet": "10.0.0.0/24",
      "ip": "10.131.0.26"
    }
  }'
```
- Defines an OVS bridge (ovs-br0) to connect the VM.
- Uses IP Address Management (IPAM) to assign IP addresses.
- Configures OVN-Kubernetes as the network type.

OVS Bridge Node Configuration Policy with OVN:
- To create an OVS bridge on a worker node, define a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP).
```yaml
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: ovs-bridge-policy
spec:
  nodeSelector: # Targets worker nodes.
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
    - name: ovs-br0 # Sets the OVS bridge (ovs-br0).
      description: OVS bridge with ens4 as a port
      type: ovs-bridge # Specifies the bridge type.
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
      bridge:
        options:
          stp:
            enabled: false
        port:
        - name: ens4 # Uses the ens4 physical NIC for the bridge.
```
- Best Practice: If nodes have different NIC names, label nodes accordingly and modify nodeSelector.

Configuring IP Addresses on a VM:
- VMs in the pod network get ephemeral IPs (no static assignment).
- To assign a static/dynamic IP, attach a secondary network interface to the OVS bridge.
- A DHCP server must be available to assign dynamic IPs.

Configuring a Static IP using cloud-init:
```yaml
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
  volumes:
  - cloudInitNoCloud:
      networkData: |
        version: 2
        ethernets:
          eth1:
            addresses:
            - 192.168.51.150/24
```
- Assigns 192.168.51.150 as a static IP to eth1.
- The QEMU guest agent must be installed to display IPs in the OpenShift console.
