### Configuring Multihomed Nodes and Virtual Machines

NMState Operator Overview: The NMState operator is a tool in OpenShift that allows you to configure and manage network settings on OpenShift nodes declaratively. It helps in:
- Reporting node network states.
- Applying and validating network configurations.
- Configuring additional network interfaces (e.g., Linux bridges).
- You install the NMState operator from the OperatorHub and then create an NMState instance (nmstate) to deploy the controller on all nodes.

API Resources provided by NMState:
- NodeNetworkState (NNS): Shows the current network configuration of a node.
- NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP): Defines intended network configurations for nodes.
- NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment (NNCE): Monitors the application of NNCP and rolls back changes if needed.
