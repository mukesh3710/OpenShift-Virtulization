### Creating a Virtual Machine in OpenShift from Web Console

You can create VMs in OpenShift using:
- The Web Console – By using the Virtual Machine Creation Catalog, which provides pre-configured templates.
- YAML Definitions – Directly defining a VM using YAML via the web console or CLI (oc command).

Using the Catalog to Create a VM:
- OpenShift provides default templates for OS like RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and Windows.
- Some templates require a Boot source.
- Customization options include: Adding SSH keys, Defining cloud-init for automation, Adding disks
- Some templates may not work on single-node OpenShift clusters.

VM Configuration Parameters:
- Project (Namespace): The VM is created in a specific project/namespace.
- VM Name: Unique name for the VM in OpenShift.
- SSH Access: Configures SSH keys for secure remote access.
- Start VM after creation: Choose to power it on immediately or keep it off.

Virtual Machine Templates:
- Red Hat provides default templates for different OS configurations.
- Users can modify templates to include: Specific boot sources, Additional storage and network interfaces
- KubeVirt common-templates package allows templates for OS like Ubuntu or openSUSE.

Creating a VM via YAML:
- YAML provides more flexibility in defining VM settings.
- YAML files can be edited via the web console or CLI (oc edit).
- Modifications include: System resources (CPU, memory), Boot sources, Network and storage settings

Managing Virtual Machines:
- Each VM has a management page in OpenShift with various options:
- Actions -  Start, stop, or delete a VM from the Actions menu.
- Configuration Tabs
  - Overview: General VM details and events.
  - Metrics: Displays CPU, memory, network usage, etc.
  - Storage: Manage disks and filesystems.
  - Network: Manage VM network interfaces.
  - SSH: Configure SSH keys and access.
  - Scheduling: Set up node placement rules and migration strategies.
  - Snapshots: Manage VM backups.
- Changing VM Resources
  - To modify CPU and memory, go to Configuration → Details, adjust values, and save changes.
  - Some changes require a VM restart or migration.

Accessing Virtual Machines: You can access VMs via:
- Web Console: Navigate to Virtualization → VirtualMachines. Select the VM and click Console. VNC Console: Provides graphical access. Serial Console: Direct CLI-based access.
- CLI (virtctl tool): `oc login` `oc project vm-project-name` `virtctl console vm-name` `virtctl vnc vm-name`
- Using External VNC Clients: Use TigerVNC, TightVNC, or RDP for Windows VMs. For RDP, install the QEMU guest agent on the Windows VM.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
OpenShift has predefined cluster roles for managing permissions:

| Cluster Role  | Permissions                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `admin`       | View & modify all resources except quotas.        |
| `cluster-admin` | Full control over all projects.                   |
| `edit`        | Modify most objects but not roles/bindings.       |
| `view`        | View most objects but cannot modify.              |

**Additional Virtualization Roles:**

| Virtualization Role   | Permissions                                                            |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `kubevirt.io:view`    | View all virtualization resources.                                     |
| `kubevirt.io:edit`    | Modify all virtualization resources but not runtime config.             |
| `kubevirt.io:admin`   | Full control over virtualization resources & runtime config. |
