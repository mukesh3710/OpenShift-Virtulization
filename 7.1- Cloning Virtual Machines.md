### Cloning Virtual Machines

What is Cloning?:
- Cloning a VM creates an exact copy of an existing VM.
- It is faster and more reliable than manually installing and configuring a new VM.
- Cloned VMs may inherit unique identifiers from the original VM (e.g., Windows SID, SSH keys, SSL certificates, Red Hat subscriptions).
- Running both the original and cloned VM simultaneously can cause conflicts.
- Sealing a VM before cloning removes machine-specific settings to avoid conflicts.

How to Prepare a VM for Cloning:
- Set up a VM as a model with the necessary OS, applications, and configurations.
- Ensure the VM includes the QEMU guest agent for OpenShift Virtualization.
- Remove unique information, such as: MAC addresses, Hostnames, Static IP addresses & Logs and system-specific data.

Sealing a VM:
- For Windows: Use sysprep.exe to reset system-specific information.
- For RHEL: Use virt-sysprep, which directly edits the disk image and removes unique information.
- OpenShift Virtualization provides virtctl guestfs to interact with VM disk images for modifications.

Steps to Seal and Clone a VM:
- Prepare the VM: Install and configure the required OS and software. Ensure the VM includes necessary guest agents and tools.
- Seal the VM: Windows: Run sysprep.exe and shut down the VM. Linux (RHEL): Use virt-sysprep to remove machine-specific data.
```bash
virt-sysprep -a /dev/vda
virt-sysprep -a /dev/vda --enable ca-certificates,user-account --remove-user-accounts cloud-user # to select specific operation
```
- Clone the VM using OpenShift Web Console: Stop the VM. Select Actions → Clone Virtual Machine. `virtctl create clone --source-name golden-vm --target-name new-vm`

Cloning Virtual Machine Disks:
- OpenShift Virtualization uses Containerized Data Importer (CDI) to clone VM disks.
- The cloning process depends on the StorageProfile resource:
  - CSI Volume Cloning (csi-clone) – Uses backend storage cloning.
  - Snapshot Cloning (snapshot) – Uses storage snapshots.
  - Host-Assisted Cloning (copy) – Uses Kubernetes pods to copy data (slower).
 
Cloning a VM Disk Using a Data Volume:
- Create a DataVolume resource to clone a disk.
```yaml
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: documentroot-clone1
spec:
  storage:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
    storageClassName: ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization
  source:
    pvc:
      name: documentroot
      namespace: golden-vms
```
- If the original VM is running, the cloning process remains in the CloneInProgress phase.
- Once the VM is stopped, the cloning completes, and the new disk can be attached to another VM.
