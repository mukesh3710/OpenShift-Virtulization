### Backup and Restore with OADP

Best Practices:
- Avoid backing up ephemeral resources like endpoints and replica sets.
- Ensure backup storage is highly available and reliable.
- Use labels and namespace filtering to avoid unnecessary backups.
- Validate the backup with test restores in non-production environments.
- Schedule backups at off-peak hours to reduce system load.

Key Takeaways:
- OADP enables backup and restore of stateful applications in OpenShift.
- Backup Hooks help ensure application consistency.
- Namespace UID/GID must be backed up for restoring access permissions.
- Kopia is used for efficient object storage backup.
- Schedules allow automatic, recurring backups.
- Manual backups can be triggered from schedules.
- TTL settings allow automatic cleanup of old backups.

- The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is a tool for backing up and restoring Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes in OpenShift. It relies on Velero, CSI snapshots, and Data Mover to perform backups and restores efficiently.

- Key Components of OADP - OADP introduces Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRs) to manage backups, restores, and scheduling:
- - Backup
    - Creates a snapshot of Kubernetes resources and volumes.
    - Stored in an object storage location.
    - Synchronization happens between OpenShift and the backup storage.
  - Restore
    - Recovers application data from a backup.
    - Data Mover ensures that volumes and persistent data are restored properly.
  - Schedule
    - Automates backups using a Cron job format.
    - Defines a recurring backup schedule.
   
Backup Process in OpenShift:
- An administrator creates a backup resource in openshift-adp.
- Velero exports Kubernetes resources from the application namespace.
- Velero CSI plug-in takes a snapshot of the application volume.
- Data Mover clones the snapshot into openshift-adp.
- A PVC is created from the snapshot.
- Data Mover uses Kopia to transfer data to the backup storage.
- Once backup completes, Data Mover deletes snapshots and temporary PVCs.

Restore Process in OpenShift:
- An administrator creates a restore resource in openshift-adp.
- Velero imports Kubernetes resources from the backup storage.
- Data Mover creates a temporary PVC and transfers data to the volume.
- The application PVC is restored but remains in a pending state.
- Once transfer is complete, the restored PV is bound to the application.

Using Velero CLI for Backup & Restore: 
- List backups and restores: `oc -n openshift-adp get backup,restore` `velero get backup` `velero get restore`
- Describe backup details: `velero describe backup website --details`
- Create a backup
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: website-label
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - website
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hugo
```
- Restore backup to a new namespace: `velero create restore website-dev --from-backup=website-label --namespace-mappings=website:website-dev`
- Check restore details: `velero describe restore website-dev --details`

Why Use Backup Hooks?:
- Stateful applications rely on persistent storage (PVCs and PVs). To ensure data consistency:
- Volume Snapshots are used for backup, but they must capture a consistent state.
- Some applications (like databases) must be quiesced (paused) before taking a snapshot to avoid data corruption.
- Backup Hooks allow you to execute commands before and after backups to manage application state.

Handling UID/GID Changes on Restore:
- OpenShift assigns a unique UID/GID to each namespace.
- When restoring to a new namespace, UID/GID changes can prevent the application from accessing its data.
- Solution: Include the namespace resource in the backup to restore UID/GID mappings.

Types of Backup Hooks:
- Pre Backup Hooks: Run before the backup starts. If they fail, the backup stops immediately with a Failed status. Example: Lock a database to prevent writes during backup.
- Post Backup Hooks: Run after the backup is taken. If they fail, the backup continues, but with a PartiallyFailed status. Example: Unlock a database after backup.
- Init Restore Hooks: Run before the restored container starts. Example: Removing a database lock file before the database starts. If they fail, restore continues, but the pod might end up in an Init:Error state.
- Post Restore Hooks: Run after the application pod is restored and running. Example: Performing a database integrity check after restore.

Example: MongoDB Backup with Hooks:
- The following backup definition for a MongoDB application:
- Locks the database (db.fsyncLock()) before backup.
- Unlocks the database (db.fsyncUnlock()) after backup.
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: mongodb
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - mongodb
  includedResources:
  - deployments
  - services
  - secret
  - pvc
  - pv
  - pods
  - namespace
  hooks:
    resources:
    - name: mongodb-lock
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: mongodb
      pre:
      - exec:
          container: mongodb
          command:
          - /usr/bin/mongosh
          - --eval
          - db.fsyncLock();
      post:
      - exec:
          container: mongodb
          command:
          - /usr/bin/mongosh
          - --eval
          - db.fsyncUnlock();
```

Example: MongoDB Restore with Hooks
- This restore definition:  Removes the lock file before the database starts.
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: mongodb
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: mongodb
  hooks:
    resources:
    - name: mongodb-unlock
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: mongodb
      postHooks:
      - init:
          initContainers:
          - name: remove-lock
            image: mongodb/mongodb-community-server:7.0-ubi8
            volumeMounts:
            - name: mongodb-data
              mountPath: /data/db
            command:
            - /usr/bin/rm
            - /data/db/mongod.lock
```

How Data is Stored in Object Storage:
- OADP uses Kopia for storing backups in object storage.
- Kopia encrypts, deduplicates, and compresses backups.
- Each namespace gets a separate backup repository.

Scheduling Recurring Backups:
- You can schedule backups at regular intervals using cron expressions.
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: website-daily
  namespace: openshift-adp
  labels:
    app: hugo
spec:
  schedule: "0 7 * * *"
  paused: false
  template:
    includedNamespaces:
    - website
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: hugo
    includedResources:
    - imagestreams
    - buildconfigs
    - deployments
    - services
    - routes
    ttl: 720h0m0s
```

Manually Creating a Backup from a Schedule:
- To trigger a backup manually using an existing schedule: `velero create backup pre-upgrade-1.1 --from-schedule website-daily`  Uses the website-daily schedule to create a pre-upgrade-1.1 backup.
- To list backups related to an app: `velero get backup -l app=hugo`

Cleaning Up Old Backups: `velero delete backup backup-name`

---

Backing Up a Virtual Machine with OADP:
- OADP can back up KubeVirt virtual machines running on an OpenShift cluster.
- The backup definition must include the kubevirt.io/virtualmachine resource type.
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: my-vm-backup
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - my-vm
  includedResources:
  - kubevirt.io/virtualmachine
  hooks:
    resources:
    - name: my-vm-pre-backup
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubevirt.io/virtualmachine: my-vm
      pre:
      - exec:
          container: my-vm
          command:
          - /usr/bin/virsh
          - suspend
```
- The pre-backup hook suspends the VM (virsh suspend) before creating the backup to ensure consistency.
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: my-vm-restore
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: my-vm-backup
  hooks:
    resources:
    - name: my-vm-post-restore
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubevirt.io/virtualmachine: my-vm
      post:
      - exec:
          container: my-vm
          command:
          - /usr/bin/virsh
          - resume my-vm
```
- The post-restore hook resumes the VM (virsh resume) after the restore is complete.
- Commands to Manage VM Backups:
- List backups: `velero get backups`
- Restore from backup: `velero restore create --from-backup my-vm-backup`

Backing Up Volumes with Kopia:
- OADP uses Kopia when volume snapshots are not supported. Kopia stores backups in an object storage repository.
- Velero exports all Kubernetes resources from the application namespace.
- The node-agent daemonset (runs on the same node as the application pod) exports volume data.
- Kopia stores the volume backups in object storage.
- Enabling Kopia Backup for All Volumes. Multiple volumes can be included with annotation: Backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: volume1,volume2,volume3
```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: my-backup
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  defaultVolumesToKopiaBackup: true
```

Restore Process with Kopia:
- Velero imports Kubernetes resources.
- The node-agent daemonset restores application data.
- Kopia restores volume data from the repository.

Troubleshooting Backups & Restores:
- Check backup status: `velero get backup mybackup`
- Get backup details: `velero describe backup mybackup`
- View backup logs: `velero backup logs mybackup`
- Download logs from S3: `s3cmd get s3://backup-bucket/oadp/backups/mybackup/mybackup-logs.gz`
- Debugging Hooks: `velero backup logs mybackup | grep hookPhase`
