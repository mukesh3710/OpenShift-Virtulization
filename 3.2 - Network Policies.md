### Network Policies

Summary
- Network Policies help restrict traffic inside namespaces.
- AdminNetworkPolicy (ANP) controls traffic at the cluster level.
- Policies apply based on labels (on pods & namespaces).
- Ingress & Egress rules define who can send/receive traffic.
- Ports must be explicitly defined in policies.
---
By default, all pods in a namespace can communicate with each other and with pods in other namespaces. To restrict communication, you must define Network Policies.

Namespace Labeling for Policies:
- To target namespaces in a Network Policy, you label them
- Using Web Console: Navigate to Administration → Namespaces → Select a namespace → Edit labels in the Details tab.
- Using CLI: `oc label namespace prod-front name=client-ns` This assigns the label name=client-ns to the prod-front namespace.

Defining a Network Policy:
- A NetworkPolicy defines which pods can communicate and on which ports.
```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: network-1-policy
spec: # Specifies rules for incoming traffic.
  podSelector: # The policy applies to pods with tier=backend in the current namespace.
    matchLabels:
      tier: backend 
  ingress:
  - from: # Defines allowed sources.
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: client-ns
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          tier: front # Pods labeled tier=front in namespaces labeled name=client-ns can access.
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: server-ns # Any pod from a namespace labeled name=server-ns can access.
    ports:
    - port: 8080 # ports: Allows only traffic on port 8080 using TCP.
      protocol: TCP
```

Creating Policies via OpenShift Web Console:
- Go to Networking → NetworkPolicies → Create Network Policy
- Use the form to configure:
  - Ingress Rules (incoming traffic)
  - Egress Rules (outgoing traffic)
  - Namespace Selectors
  - Pod Selectors
  - Ports
- Due to a bug in OpenShift 4.16.2, manually adjust the namespace in YAML before applying the policy.

Cluster-Scoped Network Policies (AdminNetworkPolicy - ANP):
- In addition to namespaced policies, OpenShift provides AdminNetworkPolicy (ANP), which applies cluster-wide rules.
- Key Attributes in ANP
  - subject: Specifies targeted namespaces or pods.
  - priority: Determines rule evaluation order (lower value = higher priority).
  - action: Can be: Allow → Permits ingress/egress. Deny → Blocks ingress/egress. Pass → Defers to namespaced policies
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdminNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: sample-anp-allow-monitoring
spec:
  priority: 50 # priority: 50 → Rules with lower priority values are enforced first.
  subject:
    namespaces:
      matchLabels:
        security: unrestricted # subject → Targets namespaces labeled security=unrestricted.
  ingress:
  - name: "allow-monitoring-unrestricted" # ingress → Allows traffic from the monitoring namespace.
    action: "Allow" # action: Allow → Grants access.
    from:
    - namespaces:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring
```
