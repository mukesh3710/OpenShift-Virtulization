### Advanced Networking with Multus CNI

Summary:
- Multus CNI enables multiple network interfaces for pods and VMs in OpenShift.
- It chains other CNI plug-ins like bridge, macvlan, and SR-IOV for advanced networking.
- Use cases include performance optimization, security isolation, and external connectivity.
- Configuration is managed via NetworkAttachmentDefinition CRs and Cluster Network Operators.

Overview of Multus CNI: Multus CNI is a Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in that enables Kubernetes pods (including OpenShift Virtualization VMs) to have multiple network interfaces. This allows virtual machines (VMs) and pods to connect to multiple networks, such as:
- Internal cluster networks for communication between services.
- External networks for connecting to outside resources.
- Isolated networks for security or performance optimization.

Kubernetes Networking Model:
- Every pod in Kubernetes gets a unique IP address.
- Pods can communicate without Network Address Translation (NAT).
- Containers within a pod share the same network namespace and can communicate using localhost.
- Node ports allow external traffic to reach pods.

Multus CNI in OpenShift Virtualization:
- Multus acts as a "meta plug-in" that chains other CNI plug-ins to attach additional network interfaces.
- By default, every pod in OpenShift has an eth0 interface that connects to the default pod network.
- Additional interfaces (like net1, net2, etc.) are added using the Multus CNI plug-in.

Use Cases for Multus CNI:
- Performance: Separate control and data traffic to optimize high-bandwidth applications.
- Security: Isolate sensitive workloads on a separate network.
- External Network Access: Connect pods and VMs to external networks, such as storage or databases.

 Implementing Multus in OpenShift:
 - Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and NetworkAttachmentDefinition CRs to define additional networks.
 - Cluster Network Addons Operator (CNAO) for managing extra network configurations.

Network Plug-ins Supported by Multus:
- Bridge:	Connects pods and VMs via a Linux bridge on the same host.
- Host-device:	Provides direct access to a physical network device.
- IPVLAN:	Shares the hostâ€™s IP subnet while using the same MAC address.
- MACVLAN:	Assigns unique MAC addresses to each pod/VM, allowing communication like physical devices.
- SR-IOV:	Enables direct hardware access for high-performance networking.

Configuring a Network Attachment Definition:
- To add an extra network, define a NetworkAttachmentDefinition in YAML. Example for a Linux bridge:
```yaml
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: bridge-dev
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: bridge.network.kubevirt.io/bridge-dev
spec:
  config: '{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "bridge-dev",
    "type": "cnv-bridge",
    "bridge": "dev-bridge",
    "macspoofchk": true,
    "vlan": 0
  }'
```
- Apply this configuration using: `oc create -f linux-bridge-dev.yml -n multus-test`
- Verify the network attachment: `oc get net-attach-def -n multus-test`
