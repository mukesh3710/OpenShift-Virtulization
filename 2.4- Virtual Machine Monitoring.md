### Virtual Machine Monitoring

Summary:
- Red Hat OpenShift provides monitoring using Prometheus-based tools, similar to VMware's vCenter.
- RBAC in OpenShift: Assigning the view role allows users to retrieve VM performance metrics.
- Monitoring Performance: OpenShift provides built-in tools (Web Console and PromQL) for real-time VM monitoring.
- Generating Load: Running a stress test helps in observing real-time resource consumption trends.
- Using PromQL: OpenShift integrates with Prometheus for querying performance metrics.

Web Console Monitoring:
- Navigate to: Virtualization → VirtualMachines
- Select the Project from the Projects menu.
- Click on a VM to open its Overview tab, which displays:
  - Details: Name, status, creation date, OS, and network info.
  - Utilization: CPU, Memory, Storage, Network usage (graphs available).
  - Other Cards: Hardware details, snapshots, alerts, and network interfaces.
- Admin Perspective: Virtualization → Overview → Top Consumers → Shows VMs that consume the most CPU, memory, and storage.

Command-line Monitoring:
- View logs of a VM's launcher pod: `oc logs virt-launcher-name`
- List all VMs across the cluster: `oc get vm -A`
- List VMs in a specific namespace: `oc get vm -n namespace`
- View detailed information about a specific VM: `oc describe vm vm-name -n namespace`

Using virsh inside a VM's Launcher Pod:
- To enter the virt-launcher pod, use: `oc exec -it virt-launcher-pod-name -n namespace -- /bin/bash`
- Check VM events: `virsh event vm-name --all`
- Check available memory: `virsh dommemstat vm-name`
- Check VM state: `virsh domstate vm-name`

Managing Virtual Machines with virtctl:
- List file systems on a VM: `virtctl fslist vmi-name -n namespace`
- View OS information: `virtctl guestosinfo vmi-name`

Role-based Access Control (RBAC):
- RBAC manages access to OpenShift resources at two levels::
- Cluster Role → Full cluster-wide management.
- Local Role → Project-level management.

Granting View Permissions:
- To a user: `oc create rolebinding view --clusterrole=view --user=user -n project`
- To a group: `oc create rolebinding view --clusterrole=view --group=group -n project`

To enable monitoring for user-defined projects, set:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
```

Querying Virtual Resource Metrics:
- Observing Metrics via Web Console:
  - Developer View:
    - Observe → Metrics → Run PromQL queries
    - Observe → Dashboard → View CPU, memory, network, storage I/O.
  - Administrator View: Observe → Dashboards → KubeVirt / Infrastructure Resources / Top Consumers → Identify resource-heavy VMs.
 
Useful PromQL Metrics: Kubevirt Virtual Machine Metrics:
| Metric                                         | Description                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `kubevirt_vmi_vcpu_wait_seconds`              | Time VM's vCPU spends waiting.               |
| `kubevirt_vmi_network_receive_bytes_total`    | Total network received bytes.                |
| `kubevirt_vmi_network_transmit_bytes_total`   | Total network transmitted bytes.             |
| `kubevirt_vmi_storage_read_traffic_bytes_total` | Total read storage traffic.                  |
| `kubevirt_vmi_storage_write_traffic_bytes_total`| Total written storage traffic.               |
| `kubevirt_vmi_memory_swap_in_traffic_bytes_total`| Total memory swapped in.                     |
| `kubevirt_vmi_memory_swap_out_traffic_bytes_total`| Total memory swapped out.                    |

### Exercise -1 

- Inspect RBAC Policies: Understanding the existing role-based access control (RBAC) settings in different projects.
- Granting RBAC Permissions: Assigning the view cluster role to a non-cluster administrator (developer user) to allow access to VM performance metrics.

Commands:
- Check the current role bindings: `oc get rolebindings -n vm - wide`
- Assign the view role to the developer user: `oc create rolebinding view --clusterrole==view --user=developer -n vm`
- Verify the assigned permissions: `oc get rolebindings view -n vm -o wide`

### Exercise -2

- Retrieving Performance Metrics: Using both the OpenShift web console and PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to monitor VM resource consumption.

Log in to the OpenShift Web Console: 
- Switch to Administrator view:
- Navigate to: Virtualization → Overview → Top Consumers
  - Set time range to Last 5 minutes.
  - Select All Projects to see CPU and memory usage.

Viewing Metrics for a Specific Project: 
- Switch to Developer view.
  - Navigate to: Observe → Project: production-vms
  - Set time range to Last 5 minutes.
  - Observe CPU and memory usage for all pods in the project.

Viewing Metrics for a Specific VM:
- Switch back to Administrator view.
- Navigate to: Virtualization → Virtual Machines → production-vms
  - Select production-mariadb VM.
  - Open the Metrics tab.
  - Set time range to Last 5 minutes.
  - Observe resource consumption.

Generating Load on the VMs and Monitoring Metrics:
- Open a console session for the production-mariadb VM.
- Run a stress test to simulate resource usage: `./stress-load.sh`
- Observe the impact in the Metrics tab.

Viewing Top Resource Consumers:
- As an admin user, go to:
- Virtualization → Overview → Top Consumers.
- Observe → Dashboards → KubeVirt / Infrastructure Resources / Top Consumers.
- Click Inspect to view the PromQL queries.
