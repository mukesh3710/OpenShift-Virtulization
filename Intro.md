## Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

### Hardware Virtualization (VM-Based)
Hardware virtualization enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server using a hypervisor, which abstracts the underlying hardware and allocates resources dynamically.

Key Components:
Hypervisor (Type-1 or Type-2) – Manages VMs and resource allocation.
Virtual Machines (VMs) – Guest OS instances running on the hypervisor.
Orchestration & Management Tools – Used for centralized VM provisioning, monitoring, and scaling.
Examples:
VMware ESXi (Hypervisor) → vCenter (Management Tool)
RHEV-H (KVM-based Hypervisor) → RHEV-M (Red Hat Virtualization Manager)
