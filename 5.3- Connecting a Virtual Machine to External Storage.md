### Connecting a Virtual Machine to External Storage

Understanding Storage in OpenShift vs. VMware:
- In VMware, storage is often shared across multiple VMs via a datastore.
- In OpenShift, each VM gets its own Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), which binds to a Persistent Volume (PV).
- Dynamic provisioning allows Kubernetes to create PVs automatically, but in some cases, manual (static) provisioning is required.

Options to Connect a VM to External Storage:
- There are two ways to attach storage to a VM:
- From inside the VM:
  - The VM mounts external storage using OS tools (e.g., SMB, NFS, or iSCSI).
  - Useful for network-based storage.
  - Multus and the Kubernetes NMState Operator help configure dedicated storage networks.
- Using a Kubernetes PV:
  - A PV represents a specific storage resource.
  - A PVC binds to a PV and is attached as a disk to the VM.

Creating a Persistent Volume (PV):
- A PV is a static storage resource that must be created manually when dynamic provisioning isn't available.
- iSCSI PV Example. Uses Block mode for VM disks. ReadWriteOnce mode restricts access to a single node.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: iscsi-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 50Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block
  claimRef:
    name: websrv1-staticimgs
    namespace: vm-project
  iscsi:
     targetPortal: 192.168.51.40:3260
     iqn: iqn.1986-03.com.ibm:2145.disk1
     lun: 0
     initiatorName: iqn.1994-05.com.redhat:openshift-nodes
```
- NFS PV Example. Uses ReadWriteMany mode, allowing multiple VMs to share storage. Uses Filesystem mode.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 20Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  claimRef:
    name: websrv1-logs
    namespace: vm-project
  nfs:
    path: /exports-ocp/vm135
    server: 10.20.42.42
```
- Fibre Channel (FC) PV Example. Uses Block mode. Requires FC storage and HBAs.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: fc-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block
  claimRef:
    name: dbsrv1-binlog
    namespace: vm-project
  fc:
    targetWWNs:
      - "50060e801049cfd1"
    lun: 0
```

Creating a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):
- A PVC is a request for storage. It must match the PV configuration. `oc apply -f pvc.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: websrv1-staticimgs
  namespace: vm-project
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block
```

Attaching Storage to a VM:
- A PVC must be attached to a VM to act as a disk.
- The volume remains empty unless a disk image is uploaded.

Injecting a Disk Image into the PVC:
- To upload a QCOW2/ISO/IMG disk image: `virtctl image-upload pvc websrv1-staticimgs --image-path=./webimgfs.qcow2 --no-create`
- In OpenShift, this can also be done through the web console.

Attaching the PVC to a VM:
- Go to Virtualization → VirtualMachines.
- Select the VM.
- Navigate to Configuration → Storage.
- Click Add disk.
- Choose PVC and select the appropriate claim.

Important Notes:
- Deleting a PVC does not delete the PV.
- Cluster admins must manually release a PV for reuse by removing the uid from the claimRef.
- Live migration requires ReadWriteMany access mode (only available for NFS, not iSCSI or FC).

### Exercise

- This guided exercise walks through the process of attaching an external iSCSI-based storage to a virtual machine (VM) running MariaDB in an OpenShift environment.
