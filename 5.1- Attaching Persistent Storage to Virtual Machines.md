### Attaching Persistent Storage to Virtual Machines

Kubernetes Storage Basics:
- Ephemeral Storage: Containers have temporary storage that disappears when a pod is deleted.
- Persistent Storage: To retain data beyond pod lifetimes, Kubernetes uses Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

How Kubernetes Connects to Storage:
- Container Storage Interface (CSI): Plug-ins that allow Kubernetes to connect to various back-end storage solutions
- Storage Classes: Define the characteristics of storage (e.g., speed, resiliency). Storage provisioners create PVs dynamically when a PVC is requested.

Persistent Volume (PV) vs. Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):
- PV: An administrator-defined storage resource in the cluster.
- PVC: A request by a user for storage, which gets bound to an available PV.

Provisioning Methods:
- Static Provisioning: Admins manually create PVs mapped to storage (e.g., NFS, SAN).
- Dynamic Provisioning: Kubernetes automatically creates PVs when a PVC is made.

Volume Modes:
- Filesystem Mode: Mounted as a directory (default).
- Block Mode: Raw block device access, often used for VMs.

Access Modes:
- RWO (ReadWriteOnce): Mounted read/write on a single node.
- RWX (ReadWriteMany): Shared across multiple nodes.
- ROX (ReadOnlyMany): Multiple nodes can mount read-only.
- RWOP (ReadWriteOncePod): Exclusive to a single pod.
- VM Live Migration requires RWX storage.

Attaching Storage to Virtual Machines:
- VM Disks use PVCs:
  - Block Mode PVCs: Disk image directly written into storage.
  - Filesystem Mode PVCs: A disk.img file is created in the PV.
- Storage Profiles:
  - Defined per storage class to set optimal defaults for VMs.
  - Example: ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization optimized for VM disks.
- Data Volumes:
  - A higher-level abstraction for defining VM disks.
  - Can fetch images from URLs or clone existing PVCs.

Example PVC YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: dbdata
spec:
  storageClassName: ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
```

Example Data Volume for a VM:
```yaml
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: vm1
  namespace: storage-intro
spec:
  pvc:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
    storageClassName: ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization
    volumeMode: Block
  source:
    http:
      url: http://images.example.com/openshift4/images/mariadb-server.qcow2
```
- Creates a VM disk from a remote image source.
- Uses Block mode for optimal VM performance.

Listing Storage Classes & PVCs:
```bash
oc get storageclasses
oc get pvc
oc get datavolumes -n storage-intro
```

### Exercise 

This guided exercise walks you through the process of attaching, verifying, and detaching persistent storage for virtual machines (VMs) running in an OpenShift Virtualization environment. Here's a breakdown:

Attaching a 5 GiB Disk to vm:
- This disk will use Ceph RBD storage, which provides fast block storage.
- Open the VM details. -> Click Actions → Stop -> Wait until the VM stops
- Go to Configuration → Storage -> Click Add disk. ->  Enter the following details & Check Apply optimized StorageProfile settings.
```makefile
Name: dbdata
Source: Empty disk (blank)
Size: 5 GiB
Type: Disk
Interface: VirtIO
StorageClass: ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization
```
```makefile
Name: staticdata
Source: Empty disk (blank)
Size: 10 GiB
Type: Disk
Interface: VirtIO
StorageClass: nfs-storage # Keep Filesystem mode.
```
- Start vm -> Click Actions → Start.
- Verify disk inside VM -> Open the Console tab. root@vm1:~# lsblk -> You should see a vdc block device.

Detaching the Disk:
- Stop vm2 -> Go to Configuration → Storage -> Click the ⋮ (ellipsis) menu next to staticdata -> Click Detach.
- Start vm2 -> Verify inside VM: root@vm2:~# lsblk. The vdc disk should be gone.
