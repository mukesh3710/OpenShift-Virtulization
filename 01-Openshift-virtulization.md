## Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization

### KubeVirt
KubeVirt lets you run virtual machines (VMs) on top of Kubernetes.  Think of it as bridging the gap between containers and VMs.  Instead of just deploying containerized applications, you can also run traditional VMs alongside them, all managed by Kubernetes.  This is useful for running legacy applications, applications that require a full operating system, or applications that have licensing constraints that require VMs.  KubeVirt makes VMs first-class citizens in the Kubernetes world.
