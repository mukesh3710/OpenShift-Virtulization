### Networking for Virtual Machines

---
#### Summary:
- Kubernetes SDN allows pod-to-pod communication across nodes.
- OpenShift manages SDN using Cluster Network Operator (CNO) with OVN-Kubernetes.
- Services provide a stable IP for exposing pods and VMs.
- Internal DNS resolves services using servicename.namespace.svc.cluster.local.
- Headless services allow direct pod connections without load balancing.
- VMs in OpenShift are managed by virt-launcher pods, which can be exposed via Kubernetes services.

Kubernetes Software-Defined Networking (SDN):
- Kubernetes assigns IP addresses from a shared subnet to all pods, allowing pod-to-pod communication across nodes and namespaces.
- This is achieved using a Software-Defined Network (SDN), which enables dynamic control of network traffic, similar to VMware vSwitch.

Cluster Network Operator (CNO) in OpenShift:
- OpenShift uses the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) to manage SDN.
- The CNO configures network interfaces using Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-ins.
- The default plug-in in OpenShift is OVN-Kubernetes, which uses Open vSwitch (OVS) on each node.

Exposing Pods and Virtual Machines:
- Pods are ephemeral (created/destroyed dynamically).
- Since each pod has a unique IP, addressing them directly is difficult.
- Kubernetes Services provide a stable IP address and load balancing for pods and VMs.
- OpenShift exposes services externally using Routes.

Pod and Service Subnets:
- Kubernetes uses separate subnets for pods and services.
- You can check these configurations using: `oc get network/cluster -o yaml`
```yaml
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.8.0.0/14 # Pod subnet
    hostPrefix: 23
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16 # Service subnet
  networkType: OVNKubernetes
```

Addressing Services via DNS:
- Kubernetes has an internal DNS system that resolves services using the format:
`servicename.namespace.svc.cluster.local`
`getent hosts backend.prod2.svc.cluster.local`

Virtual Machines in OpenShift:
- VMs run inside virt-launcher pods, which:
  - Get an IP from the pod SDN.
  - Use a DHCP server to assign an IP to the VM.
  - Route traffic between the VM and the outside world.

Exposing a VM Using a Service:
- Label the VM for service selection:
```
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: backendvm
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: backend  # Label to match the service selector
```
- Create a Kubernetes service to expose the VM:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: prod2
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    tier: backend
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```
- Apply the service: `oc create -f service.yaml`

Using virtctl to Expose a VM:
- Another way to expose a VM using virtctl: `virtctl expose vmi backendvm --name backend --type ClusterIP --port 80 --target-port 8080`

Headless Services for Direct Pod Communication:
- A headless service allows direct pod connections without load balancing.
- To create a headless service, set clusterIP: None:
```
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Service
 metadata:
   name: mysubdomain
   namespace: prod2
 spec:
   type: ClusterIP
   selector:
     tier: backend
   clusterIP: None
   ports:
   - protocol: TCP
     port: 1234
     targetPort: 1234
```

Verifying DNS Resolution:
- You can verify DNS resolution by running a test pod and querying the service:
`oc run mytestnet -it --rm --image=rhel8/toolbox`
`getent hosts backend.prod2.svc.cluster.local`
