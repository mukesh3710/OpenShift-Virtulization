### Red Hat OpenShift Architecture
---
Underlying Kubernetes Architecture:
- Control Plane Nodes: Manage the overall cluster, handle scheduling, monitor the state, and coordinate workloads.
- Compute Nodes: Run the actual applications (containers).
- Declarative Model: Admins define workload configurations, and Kubernetes ensures they match the desired state.
- Resources & API: Kubernetes uses a structured API for all operations, including built-in and custom resource types.
- Controllers: Continuously ensure that the cluster maintains the desired state.
- Namespaces: Isolate and organize resources for better security and management.

Kubernetes Operators & OperatorHub:
- Operators automate application lifecycle management (installation, scaling, and recovery).
- OperatorHub: A public repository for Kubernetes operators, including Red Hat OpenShift extensions.

 Red Hat OpenShift Overview:
 - Enterprise-ready Kubernetes: Adds security, monitoring, and ease of management.
 - Built on CoreOS: Uses CRI-O as a lightweight, secure container runtime.
 - Includes Developer & Admin Console: Web-based GUI for ease of use.

Red Hat OpenShift Editions:
- OpenShift Kubernetes Engine: Basic Kubernetes with security hardening.
- OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP): Adds security, serverless, GitOps, pipelines, and monitoring.
- OpenShift Platform Plus: Adds advanced cluster security, management, and a private registry.

OpenShift Web Console & CLI:
- Web Console: Provides admin and developer perspectives for cluster management.
- Common CLI Commands:
  - oc login: Authenticate to the cluster.
  - oc get: List resources.
  - oc describe: Detailed resource information.
  - oc apply: Deploy resources from YAML/JSON files.
  - oc delete: Remove resources.
  - oc logs: View container logs.
 
Red Hat Marketplace: A repository of certified enterprise operators for OpenShift, including OpenShift Virtualization.
