### MTV

Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) is a tool that helps you migrate multiple virtual machines (VMs) from platforms like:
- VMware vSphere
- Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)
- OpenStack
- Other OpenShift Virtualization clusters

The goal is to move these VMs into OpenShift Virtualization running in your OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster.

Overview:
- Install the MTV Operator: Use OpenShift Web Console or oc CLI to install the operator in the openshift-mtv namespace.
- Create a ForkliftController This is a controller that manages VM migrations.
- Add VM Providers These define where you‚Äôre migrating VMs from (e.g., vCenter, RHV, etc.) and include credentials + API endpoint.
- Set up Infrastructure Mappings
  - NetworkMap: Maps old VM networks to OpenShift networks.
  - StorageMap: Maps old VM storage/datastores to OpenShift StorageClasses.
- Create a Migration Plan
  - Choose source provider and VMs to migrate.
  - Define target OpenShift namespace.
  - Apply network/storage maps.
  - Choose cold or warm migration.
- Run the Migration Start the plan, and MTV takes care of
  - Shutting down (for cold) or syncing data while VM is on (for warm).
  - Creating VMs in OpenShift.
  - Using importer or conversion pods to transfer disks and reconfigure drivers.
 
‚ùÑÔ∏è Cold vs üî• Warm Migration:
- Cold	Powers off VM ‚Üí Copies data ‚Üí Powers on in OpenShift
- Warm	Copies data while VM is running using CBT ‚Üí Cuts over later
- CBT = Changed Block Tracking, a VMware feature that lets only changed disk blocks get copied. It's faster, but requires CBT to be enabled in vCenter and VM settings.

Key Components (Custom Resources):
- Provider	Defines source/destination virtualization system
- NetworkMap	Maps source network to OpenShift
- StorageMap	Maps source storage to OpenShift StorageClass
- Plan	Defines migration plan
- Migration	Executes the plan

VMware-Specific Notes:
- VDDK (Virtual Disk Development Kit): Needed for faster disk migration. Build a container image and push it to a private registry.
- You must: Download the VDDK tarball from VMware. Build a Dockerfile and container image. Push it to an image registry OpenShift can access (not public due to licensing).
- Also, update ESXi host memory settings to support more concurrent migrations.

Validation and Troubleshooting:
- MTV validates VMs before migration and lists concerns like unsupported devices or missing features.
- During migration: Importer pod: Just copies VM image. Conversion pod: Runs virt-v2v tool to install compatible drivers and migrate.
- Use oc logs to check the status of migration pods.

Post-Migration Cleanup:
- Archive the plan to clean up temporary resources.
- Deleting a plan without archiving does not clean up everything.
